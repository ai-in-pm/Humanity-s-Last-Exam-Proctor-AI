            "correct_answer": "1",
            "explanation": "When n=1, (a,b,c) = (1,2,2) is a solution. For n ≥ 2, no solutions exist. This can be proven by considering cases:\n\nFor n = 2: Assuming gcd(a,b,c) = 1, we get a^2+c^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3), implying a,c are multiples of 3, which leads to b being a multiple of 3, contradicting gcd(a,b,c)=1.\n\nFor n ≥ 3: If gcd(a,b,c)=1, the equation implies b must be even, then a must be even, then c must be even, contradicting gcd(a,b,c)=1."

            "explanation": "The polynomials of the form p(x) = ±x + c are the only solutions. This can be proven by showing that if p(p(x)) - x is divisible by (p(x) - x)^2, then either p(x) = x or 1 + p'(x) is divisible by p(x) - x. The latter case leads to p(x) = -x + c."

Two points P and Q are chosen independently and uniformly at random on Ω. Which value(s) of r minimize the probability that the chord PQ intersects Δ?",

            "explanation": "r = 0 (the center) minimizes the probability. This can be proven by geometric probability arguments considering the measure of favorable cases relative to the total measure of possible chords."
